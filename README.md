# Analysing the effects of using design patterns in a class attendance application

The purpose of this project is to create a software dedicated to tracking student attendance for university courses which will allow the professors using this project to create QR codes associated with a certain course. The students will be able to scan these QR codes in order to confirm their attendence. The project will be implemented using several design patterns and architectural models, the ultimate goal being to analyze the effects of these models on the application performance. 
 
## Application Description

The "Attendance List" project will be composed of two applications for two difference platforms. 

The first application will be represented by a web portal. Professors will be able to access this portal, which will contain a list of their taught classes as well as a list of the students enrolled in each course. Once they select a course, the professor will be able to generate a QR code for tracking the course attendance for the day. 

The second application will be a native mobile app. The students will log into this application using their course platform credentials, and then they will use this to scan the QR code generated by the teacher. The application will send the name of the student, the attendance status and the time of the scan to the server. 

At the end of the course, the teacher will be able to view the complete list of students that attended the course.
